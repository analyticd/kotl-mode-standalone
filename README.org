* KOutliner (freed from Hyberbole)
I wanted to extract kotl-mode out of Hyberbole so I moved the kotl directory
from Hyberbole project into its own repo, turned on debugging on error in Emacs
and kept loading it and using it until I copied over the the bits of hyperbole
that kotl-mode actually depends on (for my use). Additional things will probably
blow up as I begin to use more features of kotl-mode at which time I'll update
this repo. See the HY-COPY and COPYING files (copied over from the hyperbole
repo) for license information.

Here is my use-package form:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp         
(use-package kotl-mode
  :load-path (lambda () (expand-file-name "github.com/analyticd/kotl" ghq-root))
  :mode "\\.kotl\\'"
  :preface
  ;; Stubs to remove hyperbole dependence
  (require 'needed-missing-hyperbole-bits))
#+end_src
